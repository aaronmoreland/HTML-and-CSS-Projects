<blockquote cite="http://www.vetstreet.com/dogs/how-to-select-a-puppy-thats-right-for-you.html">Though all puppies are incredibly cute, not all are a good fit for your lifestyle. With the proper research and preparation, you can find a dog who will be a great addition to the family. The decision to adopt is far too important to be based on puppy-love-at-first-sight. The incredible range of breeds, exercise needs and temperaments makes it imperative that you do your homework.</blockquote>
